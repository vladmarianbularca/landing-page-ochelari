# landing-page-ochelari
This is my first landing page and is created as a Project for Generatia Tech Bootcamp from Digital Nation. We had a given design from FIGMA and our task was to make it a live website. The project is made in WordPress using Elementor, Envato, and other plugins. I used: HTML and CSS. 

The link of the website: https://vladmarianbularca.github.io/landing-page-ochelari/

During the deployment process, I encountered many bugs that were not visible in the working environment. After deployment, I discovered that the text was not arranged as in the original form. The problem persisted for a long time, even though the deployment process was done and redone. The solution to this was to install a new plugin and try to deploy it again. The plugin is called Export WP Page to Static HTML/CSS By ReCorp. This time the website was deployed correctly with a bug(the hamburger menu was not working in mobile view). After researching and applying many solutions, I managed to fix it and the website is working well. My fix for this problem was to select from Elementor settings: Improved Asset Loading, Improved CSS Loading, and Inline Font Icons and to inactive them. Another step was to make sure the overflow from the header section is hidden. Source article: https://ultraaddons.com/fix-your-elementor-menu-is-not-working-issues-2022/
